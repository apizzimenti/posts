## Me
-----
Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm a software and web dev at the University of Iowa ITS. I go to the University of Iowa as a math and
computer science student.

I am an avid hockey player and Detroit Red Wings fan (LGRW!). I love my family and friends, pool, math, and *The Office*.

### Background
I've been programming since I was 15 and wanted to learn to make my own website. This got me into a wide variety of web development stuff
 and drove me into taking the introductory comp sci course at my high school and then math courses at the University of Iowa. In September 
 2015 (right on my birthday), I was offered a position at the University of Iowa Information Technology Services as a student developer.

### Currently
Firstly, I like what I do. I get to go to work every day and have fun. I try to keep my programming life well-balanced,
 and so I maintain my own personal [projects](http://apizzimenti.com/#/projects), most notably a weather cli (this was developed so I could
 be lazier than I already am). I get to learn something new every day, and nobody can pass that up.

### Programming
I work primarily in JavaScript, both backend and frontend. In order, my languages go:

* JavaScript
    * Node
    * TypeScript
* Python
* LaTeX (if that counts)

I love [this talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) on js.

I also really enjoy the [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) youtube channel.
