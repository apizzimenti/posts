### Hi there
I'm Anthony, and I do web, software, and mobile development. I'll go into my work later, so for now I'll tell you about
myself. I'm a comp sci student currently working at the University of Iowa ITS. I love hockey, people, math, code, and 
(especially) food.

### Work
I love what I do and I try to enjoy every day no matter the challenges. The best part is that I actually learn something
new every day, and I can apply that anywhere.

### My Stuff
I have a lot of gear that I love to use, so here goes: I use a MacBook Air from 2012, given to me to use by the UIowa ITS.
It's a nice machine, but it's not exactly personal, so I'm going to upgrade my personal machine to a MacBook Pro. I have
a few mice that I like, and they are the Razer Abyssus and the CM Storm Spawn (from my *StarCraft* days). I also have a
Ducky Zero mechanical keyboard with brown Cherry MX switches. My headphones are Sennheiser HD 558s, and they are the most
amazing headphones I've ever owned. I'm a music fan (isn't everyone?), so I wanted a great audio experience for a good price.
Other than that, I have an old iPhone 5 and a super long cable.
