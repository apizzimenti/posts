## My Work
I have a few different types of projects, both personal and through work. I'll walk you through some of them.

### [cli-weather](https://github.com/apizzimenti/cli-weather)
This is by far my most personal project. Before winter break 2015-2016, I was feeling a little burned out after a lot of
schoolwork and poor time management. So I decided to take on a medium-scale node module project.

I was really starting to get into JavaScript and learning quite a bit about the nitty-gritty of the language. Then, I
discovered `Node.js` and immediately fell in love. I could write command line tools in my favorite language? Never thought
it'd be possible.

I immediately started thinking of things to do in the command line that'd make people's lives easier. I thought for days,
thinking about cli text editors, automatic README generators, things like that. I took a bunch of walks, and I realized
that I check the weather wayyyyy more often than I needed to and it took a long time to navigate to wunderground every
single time. [cli-weather](https://github.com/apizzimenti/cli-weather) is a super easy-to-use cli weather interface that
automatically grabs your location and gets the current conditions and a 4-day forecast.

I used an OOP model for the modules in the project so that each had easily accessible and mutable properties rather than 
a bunch of function collections and callback hell. The OOP model makes JavaScript that much easier to write and organize.
