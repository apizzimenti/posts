**February 28, 2016**

On Thursday, February 26, my girlfriend Allie, her parents Romy and Julie, and I went to an NHL game in St. Louis between the Blues and the Rangers.
Now I've been to my fair share of NHL games, but this one was different because of the care and planning that went into it.
I'll outline some of the steps that went into a great night watching the Blues lose an extremely close game.

### Phase 0: Finding out that we were going to a game
----

Around four months ago, Romy said that we'd be going to a Blues game around Allie's birthday (the Blues are her favorite team).
This got me really excited because of my level of experience with hockey and NHL games.

### Phase 1: Picking the Seats
----

In the early stages of January, Romy and I began to plan where we'd get seats. The ScottTrade Center, like any other NHL
arena (or any arena, for that matter) has a series of seating sections called 'bowls'. These bowls stretch around the entirety
of the rink and are separated by the concourse levels. In the ScottTrade Center, there are three bowls (not counting the
suite level).

In most NHL rinks, you want to aim for the lower part of the middle bowl on the inside of the side boards in an end zone
(preferably the one where the home team attacks twice). Here's why:

* when you're in between the end boards in the end zone, you can see all the way down the boards to either side; if you're
right on the boards or on the long side of the rink, the angle to the glass obscures corners and board play
* in the lower part of the middle bowl:
    * you have a concourse walkway where nobody sits; this way, there are few people in front of you
    * the floors are much more vaulted here than in the lower bowl, giving you a better angle to see into corners and along
    boards
    * super easy concourse access
    
So we found some seats in the Blues' attacking zone in section 111, which is right on the corner of the rink. This way,
we can see plays develop and also have a good angle on the net. We didn't get the tickets yet, though.

### Phase 2: Threat Level Midnight
----

It was now two weeks ago, and we still hadn't purchased the tickets. I talked to Romy about the game a little more, and 
the next day, she produced four ticket vouchers.

Gorgeous.

### Phase 3: Travel and the Plight of the Hockey Pilgrims
----

On Thursday, the day of the game, we left home and traveled down to St. Louis. When we got there, we tried to go to the arch.

Closed.

We tried to go to Union Station.

Abandoned.

So we went to the Cardinals' Ballpark Village down the street and then into the Cardinals' pro shop. After that, back
to the hotel to pig out on Drury Inn dinner.

We wanted to get to the game early to catch warmups, and so we went to the bus stop to catch the downtown trolley. We
waited for ~20 minutes and then the bus finally arrived.

...and promptly drove right past us.

So for another 20 minutes we waited and then took the bus to a location four blocks away from the arena. As we were
hailing a cab, a bus driver pulled over and asked if we were going to the game. He managed to get us through the vehicle
security checkpoint and drive us straight to the front door of the arena.

That made Allie's (and everyone else's) night quite a bit better. Then it got even better because of the NHL game (of course).

So, steps for a successful NHL game trip:
1. get good seats really early on
2. in the city of the game, go to places that are either: a. closed, or, b. abandoned
3. ?
4. profit.
5. find a nice bus driver
6. watch the game
7. profit (emotionally).
