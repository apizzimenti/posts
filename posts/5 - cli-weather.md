Recently, the traffic to my most popular npm package, `cli-weather`, has skyrocketed.

If you can tell me what's going on, then please do; I don't know if spring has sprung, people are more interested in
weather in general, or people just like the package. In any case, thank everyone so much for the downloads, and keep in
mind that I'm very dedicated to keeping this little npm module running for a long time :)

I have a few things on the agenda, including a possible rewrite using TypeScript for a little more modularity and more
ability to use the module as an api.
