I wanted to talk about my experience in the Democratic caucuses in February.

My caucus place is at Weber Elementary School in Iowa City. I thought it’d be a little nerve-wracking in the beginning, but I arrived in the cold weather and was met by Zach Wahls, one of the [speakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM7Xxmt06FU) at the Democratic National Convention in 2012. He was handing out Hillary stickers and chatting up everyone in line.

The Bernie people got fast-tracked into the building, but it wasn’t long before I got in. I signed the sheets, notified the proctors of my candidate choice, and went into the cafe, and observed.

For the next two hours, I was part of an eye-opening experience. Prior to this, I had only seen “democracy” as part of election parties and campaign speeches around my state. What I saw at this caucus was much different. There was no yelling, no [Howard Dean screaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0). I was astounded and pleased to see the reasonable discussion and friendliness between those with a mutual respect for each other and their opinions. There will be no shortage of my attendance at polls for local, state, and national elections, caucuses, school board meetings, and other events.

For the most part, grassroots politics are not filled with bigotry, hate, or closed-mindedness. It’s filled with people who care.
