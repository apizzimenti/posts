There are two types of advice that I can give any web person coming to the
_West Side Story_: job-specific and general.

### Job-Specific
-----
Get comfortable with these things:

* adding and managing users and their permissions
* creating, drafting, and publishing content
* fixing unpredictable (and sometimes weird) technical problems around the newsroom
* modifying the site from the front and back ends

Some technologies that you should be at least familiar with include PHP,
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the command line. Also, take time to learn how SNO
and WordPress work; the former is a frontend framework that provides premade
themes, SEO, and some chances for our stories to be featured on their network.
The latter is the backend technology, and is written in PHP; it's very modular
and lots of widgets/modifications that you may need are probably already written.
That said, if it doesn't exist, just write it yourself.

Learn how to use HTML and CSS; although they're finicky, making small changes
to the appearance of the site can help boost traffic to the site and keep
people there.

Google Analytics is huge, so do as much analysis of that as you can. All the 
stats are open to everyone, but let everybody know the information that you have,
even if it's kinda boring.

### General
-----
Always keep in mind that _you_ are the (or one of the) experts on how the
website works and how to manipulate it. It is impossible to please everyone,
so when it comes time to make a decision, stick to it and then just go for it.

A lot of the work you'll do may seem trivial to other people, but that's okay.
Making a slight font change, narrowing an HTML element, or `scp`ing into the
server to change a few PHP namespace configs won't be noticed, but that
doesn't reduce its importance.

Don't make the mistake I did and not go to all the worknights. Go to them;
they're fun, a good chance to get work done, and you'll be able to help a 
lot of people.

Practice your programming skills and keep them sharp.

It’s okay to make mistakes, and my friend David Wu said that “the smartest people you will ever know are those who learn from their successes and their failures”. This is unbelievably true, and it is much better to make everything a learning experience.

Finally, this class is a great time, so working hard will only help.

Good luck :)
