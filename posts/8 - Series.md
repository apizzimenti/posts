### Quirkiness
Like many of those that write JavaScript on a daily basis, I often ask myself: _Why is
this language the way that it is?_ Its weird weakly-but-dynamically typed system, the
ambiguity of its errors, lexical scoping, and closures make it sometimes a hassle to
work with. The fact that so many developers use (and sometimes butcher) JavaScript's
beauty is understandable - there are so many intricate and small things to understand.
However, mastering some of these interesting bits makes writing with the language much 
more palatable.

This series of quirk articles is dedicated to helping others better understand
JavaScript and why is it the way it is.
